# Multi-Agent Debate System: Mini-Report

## Scenario Tested

**Topic:** Should artificial intelligence be regulated to ensure ethical development?

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System supports 2-4 agents with distinct roles
2. Protocol supports at least 2 rounds of debate
3. Judge provides final verdict or indicates non-consensus
4. System runs locally on a single machine
5. System supports experiment toggles (agents, rounds, temperature)

### Devils Advocate

- **No Change in Score**

### Temperature

- **Score Improvement:** +0.5 points

## Limits and Next Steps

### Current Limitations

1. **Simplified Rating Extraction:** The system uses basic text parsing to extract numerical ratings from the judge's verdict, which may not always be accurate.
2. **Limited Context Window:** The system has a fixed maximum token limit, which may constrain very long debates.
3. **Deterministic Workflow:** The current implementation follows a fixed agent sequence, which doesn't allow for dynamic agent selection based on debate content.
4. **Basic Convergence Detection:** Convergence is determined through simple keyword matching rather than semantic analysis.

### Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Rating Extraction:** Implement more sophisticated NLP techniques to accurately extract and interpret ratings from judge's verdicts.
2. **Dynamic Agent Selection:** Develop a mechanism to dynamically select which agent should respond next based on the current state of the debate.
3. **Semantic Convergence Analysis:** Use semantic similarity measures to more accurately determine when agents have reached consensus.
4. **Expanded Agent Roles:** Introduce additional specialized agents (e.g., Ethicist, Economist, Technical Expert) for more domain-specific debates.
5. **Longer Context Support:** Implement strategies to handle longer debates, such as summarization or hierarchical memory.
